# Covid-19-Analysis-Project
In this project, I have analyzed various scenarios of COVID-19 using python and tableau. The folders contain data related to different scenarios like testing, hospitalization, daily cases, and many more.
The data in these files are cleaned and you can easily use it to create dashboards in tableau.
You can fetch fresh data from various sources like covid19india.org, ICMR, and kaggle.
