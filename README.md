# Covid-19-Analysis-Project
In this project I have done analysis on COVID-19 using python and tableau. The various folders contain data related to various scenarios like testing, hospitalization,daily cases and many more.
The data in these files is cleaned and you can easily use it to create dashborads in tableau.
You can fetch fresh data from various sources like covid19india.org, ICMR and kaggle.
